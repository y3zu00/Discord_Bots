Terms Of Service
1. Overview
This platform provides access to advanced AI trading software, educational tools, analytics, and automation systems. These include chatbots, market insights, indicators, strategy modules, portfolio tools, and Discord-based integrations.
Use of the platform or any connected service signifies agreement to these Terms of Service and the accompanying Privacy Policy.
2. Age Restriction
Users must be at least 18 years old (or the age of majority in their jurisdiction) to use this service. By accessing or using the platform, you represent and warrant that you meet this age requirement.
3. Purpose and Disclaimer
All software, AI systems, and automation tools are designed for educational, research, and entertainment purposes only.
No content or output generated by the software constitutes financial or investment advice.
Users are solely responsible for all trading decisions, actions, and results.
The platform and its developers hold no liability for financial loss, performance outcomes, or decisions made based on any output or recommendation.
The service is provided "as is" and "as available", without warranties of any kind, either express or implied, including but not limited to warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, accuracy, reliability, or non-infringement. The platform does not guarantee uninterrupted, secure, or error-free operation.
4. Membership and Access
Access is provided through paid membership tiers and optional one-time software purchases.
Tier access (Core, Pro, Elite) determines available tools and features.
One-time purchases of indicators, strategies, or other AI tools are non-transferable.
Subscriptions renew automatically unless cancelled before the renewal date.
Refund Policy: Refunds are generally not issued for subscriptions or one-time purchases. However, this policy does not override mandatory consumer rights under applicable law. Users in jurisdictions with mandatory refund rights (such as the European Union's 14-day right of withdrawal for digital services, where applicable) retain those rights. Refund requests must be submitted within the applicable legal timeframe and will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis in compliance with local consumer protection laws.
5. Data Handling
Basic user data, including Discord identifiers, emails, and usernames, may be collected for authentication, licensing, and support.
Data is stored securely and not shared or sold to third parties.
Certain integrations (e.g., Whop) manage billing and role-based access.
By purchasing or using the platform, users also agree to the terms of any third-party integration used for account or payment processing.
For detailed information about data collection, use, and your rights, please review our Privacy Policy.
6. Content and Software Usage
