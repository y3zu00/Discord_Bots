## 5. Editing Notes
- Color grade toward teal/amber (match landing page)
- Typography: use the same font as site (Inter or Poppins) for consistency
- Transitions: 
  - 12–16 frame motion blur swipes for general transitions
  - Card merge animation: smooth, elegant morph (2-3 seconds)
  - Logo to website: seamless zoom/expand with particle trail (2 seconds)
  - No hard cuts except on beat drops
- Music: energetic electronic track (build → drop around shot 4 card merge, second build for Discord reveal)
- Sound design: 
  - Soft UI clicks for dashboard interactions
  - Notification ping for Discord reveal (subtle, not jarring)
  - Smooth whoosh for card merge and logo transition
- **VO mixing:** Voiceover should sit at -3dB to -6dB below music, duck music slightly during VO
- **Mogging comparison:** Ensure smooth transition from Shot 1 to Shot 2, and from Shot 2 to Shot 3. The mogging comparison should feel like the turning point of the narrative.
- **Card merge:** Use elegant easing curves, ensure all cards are visible before merge begins
- **Logo transition:** Logo should feel like it's "opening" into the website, not just fading
- **Discord reveal:** Notification should feel natural, not intrusive—use subtle animation

---

## 6. Export & Placement
- Master export: ProRes or DNxHR 1080p
- Web version: H.264 12–15 Mbps, 24fps
- Landing page embed: lazy-load MP4 or use muted autoplay (loop optional)
- Social cutdowns (optional): 
  - 30s vertical (crop Shots 4–6: card merge, logo transition, platform showcase)
  - 60s horizontal (Shots 1–8: full narrative through Discord reveal)

---

## 7. Checklist Before Final Render
